1. Difference between var, let, and const:

   var: Function-scoped, can be redeclared and updated.

   let: Block-scoped, can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope.

   const: Block-scoped, cannot be updated or redeclared; must be initialized.

2. Difference between map(), forEach(), and filter():

   map(): Returns a new array by transforming each element.

   forEach(): Executes a function on each element; does not return a new array.

   filter(): Returns a new array with elements that pass a condition.

3. Arrow functions in ES6:

   Shorter syntax for functions.

   Do not have their own this.

   Example: const add = (a, b) => a + b;

4. Destructuring assignment in ES6:

   Extracts values from arrays or objects into variables.

   Array example: const [a, b] = [1, 2];

   Object example: const {name, age} = {name: "Tauhid", age: 18};

5. Template literals in ES6:

   Use backticks ` instead of quotes.

   Embed variables with ${}.

   Example: `Hello, ${name}!`

   Easier than string concatenation and supports multi-line strings.
